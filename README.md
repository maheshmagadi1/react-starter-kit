## About

We have seen people spending more time on infrastructural arrangement before kick starting any ReactJS project. Here is a react starter kit, which helps developers to kick start their product development from day-1 and allow to add additional tools/modules/libraries gradually. But the major thing is it doesnot block any developer on day 1. No product is perfect on Day 1. Gradually all the products reach to a better position.

## How it works

The project contains one single starter kit with this tech stack: React-Typescript-SCSS

### Pre-requisites

Before you begin, you will need to have the following tools installed on your machine:
[Git] (https://git-scm.com), [Node.js] (https://nodejs.org/en/).
In addition, it is good to have an editor to work with the code like [VSCode] (https://code.visualstudio.com/)

#### Running the web application

```bash

# Clone this repository
$ git clone https://github.com/maheshmagadi1/react-starter-kit.git

# Access the project folder in your terminal
$ cd react-starter-kit

# Install the dependencies
$ npm install

# Run the application in development mode
$ npm start

# The application will open on the port: 3000 - go to http://localhost:3000

```
